The main idea of this project is to allow users to share their travel ideas with the focus being on an event happening in Europe. It is primarily focused on people in Dublin and people travelling from Dublin anywhere in Europe. With the power of my web application, users will be able to share their great itinerary on where to go in Europe at a great deal. Likewise, users will benefit from other users’ ideas and get inspired on where to travel next, and turn their city break into a greater experience. If the user decides to share their itinerary, once they are signed up, they can share some crucial information about the event. They need to put the price of event ticket, flight price, flight carrier and the dates of departure and event date as well. This should be a good enough of a guide for site visitors to know how to avail of the deal.

Main page of the web application should already get the attention of a new user with other users’ posts, but my own ones as well. As the application grows in users, the main page should have more and more to offer leading to interesting deals that are hard to be found online.

This will be an interesting and quick source of information, and hopefully an inspiration that will lead to new users booking their holidays with its main focus being an event they will remember forever.
